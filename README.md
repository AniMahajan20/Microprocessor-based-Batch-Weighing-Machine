# Microprocessor-based-Batch-Weighing-Machine
A microprocessor based based Batch Weighing Machine which checks whether the weight under consideration is greater than or less than 50Kg. 
It also tells us the weight of the object (in kgs) up to two decimal places.

This repository contains the ALP that is linked with the simulated hardware design made using Proteus and a report containing all the nessesary information.

# Problem Statement

A microprocessor system is to be designed as a batch weighing machine. The system is interfaced to three load cells by means of a 10-bit A/D converter.

The conditioned output of the load cells is given by the equation:
    Vout = K x weight (Kgs.)
  Where K is dependent on the property of the sensor.

The system monitors the output of the load cells and finds out the total weight by taking the average of the three values that are sensed by each load cell. This value is displayed on a seven -segment di splay. When this value exceeds 50 kgs, an output port, which is connected to a relay, is switched on to sound an alarm.
